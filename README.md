## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

  Learned CSS flex properties for the first time while working for this project.
  And since this was my first time so I tried to give my best so that the site looks the same as it was shown in the screenshot, which took me time but I learned new things by doing this porject.

### Continued development

  Still I'm not good at CSS Advanced properties so lookking further improvement in learning these by doing more projects.
  And also started learning JS and Bootstarp.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qVuORLniwM&t=1383s) - This video from the youtube channel "Code with Harry" helped me for learning CSS Flexbox. I really liked his content.
